Forces known android emulators to use OpenGLES. This is a very conservative check that could be expanded over time if need be. For testing emulators can still use the debug flags.

18,"2820204959","Connection time out error on specific Mobile Networks","I am getting a strange issue which I am unable to figure out. A few of app users are complaining that app is not working. When I dig into details, I found that it was connection time out error on mobile network of specific telecom. That too happen when user get connected to 5G but more strange part is, it happens on my flutter app only and other app works fine. Now if user get back to 4g, the app works fine on other telecom network provider 5g network app works fine but there is problem with one network ( JIO 5g in India) and after 2-3 efforts of closing app and running it again make it work again. 

I tried to debug app on same network and getting connection time out error in 5g mode. I tried with both packages http and Dio but nothing changed in result

Though reattempts can be created but I want to find the answer why it happens and how it can be resolved.  Any input or help is highly appreciated. 

**Here is detailed log with Dio**

This change reverts the following previous change:
issue: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/149652
doc: (currently google only) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rulw_noQi0G8Glb47vk17uBbb6sySDxlQe-l-0kHn14/edit?tab=t.0

This increases the RMSE value in the test in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/161445 by a slight amount.  I do believe this reduces the time where we get non uniform scalars and protects the integrity of relative spacing, thus being more what we expect.  There is still a bug that has to do with pixel alignment that does give the illusion of stretching and shrinking though because of hard/soft lines.

Fixes [https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/162098](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/162098)

### Description 

This PR fixes `Tab` linear and elastic animation blinks/flickers when skipping multiple tabs. Previous attempt to fix elastic animation didn't cover linear animation tests and didn't have enough number of tab items which this PR fixes.

- Fixed Linear and elastic animation blink issue.
- Added tests for linear and elastic animation with various tab sizes  (LTR and RTL)
- Added tests for linear and elastic animation when skipping tabs (LTR and RTL)

Following the Migrating from SharedPreferences to SharedPreferencesAsync/WithCache code on the pub.dev page (https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences#migration-and-prefixes). The class SharedPreferencesOptions is unable to be found in the shared_preferences package. It needs to be imported from 'package:shared_preferences_platform_interface/types.dart' which however gives a warning: The imported package 'shared_preferences_platform_interface' isn't a dependency of the importing package. (Documentation).

### Expected results

The SharedPreferencesOptions class can be imported, and the migrateLegacySharedPreferencesToSharedPreferencesAsyncIfNecessary function can be ran. 

### Actual results

If the class is not imported, a  Error: 'SharedPreferencesOptions' isn't a type. error prevents the app from building. If the class is imported, it runs fine however importing from shared_preferences_platform_interface shows a warning

Tries to remove as much `Usage` as possible while avoiding more complicated bits that require more scrutiny to make sure we aren't losing test coverage or otherwise regressing. Said another way, almost the entire diff is just deleting code to send GA3 events, and the corresponding GA4 code can be found right next to it—making it easy to verify we aren't losing events/tests.

60,"2816747760","iOS: Token refresh issue with Firebase services after 1 hour","## Description
When using Flutter with Firebase on iOS, all Firebase services become unavailable after approximately 1 hour of usage. This might be related to how Flutter handles platform channel communication for token refresh or background tasks on iOS.

## Related Issues
- FirebaseExtended/flutterfire#11087
- FirebaseExtended/flutterfire#9989
- firebase/firebase-ios-sdk#14389

## Environment
- Flutter version: 3.27.3
- Dart SDK: >=3.6.0 <4.0.0
- Platform: iOS
- Firebase packages:
  - firebase_core: ^3.10.1
  - firebase_auth: ^5.4.1
  - cloud_firestore: ^5.6.2
  - cloud_functions: ^5.3.1
  - firebase_analytics: ^11.4.1
  - firebase_crashlytics: ^4.3.1
  - firebase_messaging: ^15.2.1

## Issue Details
The problem manifests as follows:
1. All Firebase services work correctly for the first hour after login
2. After approximately 1 hour, all Firebase services stop working
3. Various PlatformException errors are thrown
4. The app requires a force quit and relaunch to restore functionality

## Questions
1. Could this be related to how Flutter handles platform channels for background tasks?
2. Are there any known issues with long-running platform channel connections on iOS?
3. Are there specific configurations needed for proper background task handling with Firebase on iOS?

## Error Messages
```
PlatformException(unavailable, The service is currently unavailable...)
PlatformException(unknown, Unknown error or an error from a different error domain...)
PlatformException(internal-error, An internal error has occurred...)

This change reverts the following previous change:
`flutter widget-preview start` will now look for functions annotated with `@Preview()` within the developer's project. These functions will be used to generate
`.dart_tool/widget_preview_scaffold/lib/generated_preview.dart`, which inserts the returned value from each preview function into a `List<WidgetPreview>` returned from a `previews()` method that is invoked by the widget preview scaffold root.

**Example generated_preview.dart:**

```dart
// ignore_for_file: no_leading_underscores_for_library_prefixes
import 'package:foo/foo.dart' as _i1;
import 'package:foo/src/bar.dart' as _i2;
import 'package:widget_preview/widget_preview.dart';

List<WidgetPreview> previews() => [_i1.preview(), _i2.barPreview1(), _i2.barPreview2()];

76,"2816109924","New ""Best Practices"" Project Template as Skeleton Alternative","### Use case

When creating a new Flutter project, developers (especially newcomers) lack a starter template that demonstrates widely accepted best practices. The removal of the skeleton template has left a gap where projects default to the overly simplistic counter app, which doesn’t guide users on critical topics like internationalization, scalable architecture, routing, or testing. This forces developers to manually research and integrate these practices, leading to inconsistent setups, duplicated effort, and potential technical debt.

**Current Limitations**  
- The default `counter` template focuses on basic functionality, not real-world app structure.
- Newcomers often reinvent the wheel or adopt outdated patterns due to lack of official guidance.
- Teams spend time rebuilding boilerplate for routing, state management, and localization instead of focusing on features.


### Proposal

Introduce a new **official project template** (e.g., `flutter create --template best_practices`) that serves as a foundation for production-ready apps. This template would:

1. **Demonstrate Best Practices**
   - **Clean Architecture**: Separate layers (presentation, domain, data).
   - **State Management**: Provider/Riverpod/Bloc setup with example.
   - **Routing**: GoRouter/Navigator 2.0 with named routes and deep linking.
   - **Internationalization**: Localization with ARB files.
   - **Theming**: Light/dark mode, custom design system.
   - **Testing**: Unit, widget, and integration test examples.

2. **Target Audience**
   - **Newcomers**: Quick starting point to learn best practices.
   - **Experienced Devs**: Save time of boilerplate setup.

3. **Minimal but Opinionated**
   - Avoid overcomplication; focus on a structure that scales.
   - Use [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev) recommended packages where possible (e.g., `go_router` for navigation).

**Why Flutter Should Provide This**
- **Ecosystem Health**: Reduces fragmentation by promoting consistent patterns.
- **Onboarding**: Lowers the barrier to entry for new Flutter developers.
- **Adoption**: A ""batteries included"" template makes Flutter more appealing for enterprise/production use.

**Example Structure**
```dart
lib/
├─ core/
│  ├─ routes/         # Routing setup
│  ├─ themes/         # App-wide theming
│  ├─ localization/   # Generated localization classes
├─ features/
│  ├─ home/           # Feature module with presentation/domain/data

### Description 

This PR fixes `Tab` linear and elastic animation blinks/flickers when skipping multiple tabs. Previous attempt to fix elastic animation didn't cover linear animation tests and didn't have enough number of tab items which this PR fixes.

- Fixed Linear and elastic animation blink issue.
- Added tests for linear and elastic animation with various tab sizes  (LTR and RTL)
- Added tests for linear and elastic animation when skipping tabs (LTR and RTL)

84,"2814591769","Expose build name and build number as constants","### Use case

Currently, to get the build number and build name of our app, we have to use a separate package (`package_info_plus`). Since build name and build number are known at build time, it would be beneficial to get those values and expose them at the framework level to increase the developer experience and reduce the number of dependencies. 

It’s possible to achieve this behaviour by declaring constants using `—-dart-define` and consuming them with `.fromEnvironment`, but this proposal suggests a more universal (and CI-independent) approach.

### Proposal

Get build name and build number without any third-party dependencies, e.g.:
- `print(FlutterMeta.buildName)`
- `print(FlutterMeta.buildNumber)`","closed","2025-01-28 04:24:55","2025-01-28 19:21:03","0",NULL,NULL,"n-bernat",NULL,"2025-01-28 21:24:05","Padrões de Projeto","14.935555555555556"

Wrong examples in Flutter documentation

### Content
I found two examples are shown in the [HashMap](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-collection/HashMap-class.html#:~:text=A%20hash%2Dtable%20based%20implementation,();%20//%20Is%20a%20HashMap) section of the documentation.

**1st**
Adding data to `HashMap` with `addEntries()` method. Actually `addEntries()` method adds a pair of map values from the last of `Map`.
But in example add from the first.

**Error in documentation**
```
planets[3] = 'Earth';
planets.addAll({4: 'Mars'});
final gasGiants = {6: 'Jupiter', 5: 'Saturn'};
planets.addEntries(gasGiants.entries);
print(planets); // fx {5: Saturn, 6: Jupiter, 3: Earth, 4: Mars}
```

**Expected**
```
import 'dart:collection';

void main() {
  final Map<int, String> planets = HashMap();
  planets[3] = 'Earth';
  planets.addAll({4: 'Mars'});
  final gasGiants = {6: 'Jupiter', 5: 'Saturn'};
  planets.addEntries(gasGiants.entries);
  print(planets); // {3: Earth, 4: Mars, 6: Jupiter, 5: Saturn}
}
```
---

**2nd**
In this code removing the key from `HashMap` is `5` but in the example output, the value of the plants still contains a pair of `5`.
```
final removeValue = planets.remove(5);
print(removeValue); // Jupiter
print(planets); // fx {4: Mars, 3: Earth, 5: Saturn}

### Infrastructure Environment

Cocoon

### What is happening?

https://github.com/flutter/cocoon/pull/4176 replaced the `warning: land on red to fix tree breakage` label system with a new `emergency` label. The former worked in flutter/packages, and we used it to land fixes when the tree was broken, per the preferred Flutter policy of not manually landing PRs. The latter, apparently, does not. See https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/8512 where after I renamed the old label to `emergency` we just get

```
autosubmit label was removed for flutter/packages/8512, because emergency label processing failed
```

with no details about why processing failed. I'm assuming there's some repo-specific logic. Maybe it's looking for the merge queue gate, and since we don't currently have a merge queue in flutter/packages it fails?

103,"2814006086","OpenGL external textures for Windows","### Use case


Integrating video/picture rendering backends (e.g., GStreamer/ffmpeg) with Flutter can be challenging due to platform-specific texture handling.

**Current Approach:**

- Flutter recommends using [textures](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Texture-class.html): 
    > ""Backend textures are images that can be applied (mapped) to an area of the Flutter view. They are created, managed, and updated using a platform-specific texture registry. This is typically done by a plugin that integrates with host platform video player, camera, or OpenGL APIs, or similar image sources."" 


- **Windows limitations:**

    - **Pixel buffer textures:** Require memory juggling between GPU and CPU, potentially impacting performance for extreme use cases (e.g., rendering 16 video streams).
    - **D3D textures:** Difficult to use with OpenGL-only rendering backends due to the need for conversion between OpenGL and D3D textures.



### Proposal

- **Raw OpenGL texture support for Windows (hopefully across all platforms):** This would simplify integrations and potentially improve performance.

**Notes**
- See also https://medium.com/hackernoon/rendering-external-texture-an-flutter-optimization-by-alibaba-c5ed143af747 and https://www.reddit.com/r/flutterhelp/comments/1ibhhro/flutter_integration_with_opengl_like_apploica/
- My knowledge is based on current community libraries and the Flutter engine source code for external textures.
- I don't know if Impeller fixes something in that regard.

```
theme: ThemeData(colorScheme: provider.seedColor)
darkTheme: ThemeData(colorScheme: provider.seedColor)
```

but for the theming(light/dark) to work, i need to set the theme like this:

```
theme: ThemeData.light()
darkTheme: ThemeData.dark()
```

but this way the `colorScheme` won't be set, so i use `copyWith()` this way:

```
theme: ThemeData.light().copyWith(colorScheme: provider.seedColor)
darkTheme: ThemeData.dark().copyWith(colorScheme: provider.seedColor)
```

but it's not the same as if i was using the first method:

```
theme: ThemeData(colorScheme: provider.seedColor)
darkTheme: ThemeData(colorScheme: provider.seedColor)
```

now you might not understand much without looking at the code so here:
https://pastebin.com/rYtWgjd9

		}
	}
}
```

```
// app_de.arb
{
	""myDateTime"": ""{timestamp}"",
	""@myDateTime"": {
		""placeholders"": {
			""timestamp"": {
				""type"": ""DateTime"",
				""format"": ""dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss"",
				""isCustomDateFormat"": ""true""
			}
		}
	}
}
```

3. Run `flutter gen-l10n` command to generate the translation dart code (app_localizations_de.dart)

### Expected results

```
@override
String myDateTime(DateTime timestamp) {
  final intl.DateFormat timestampDateFormat = intl.DateFormat('dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss', localeName);
  final String timestampString = timestampDateFormat.format(timestamp);

  return '$timestampString';
}
```

### Actual results

```
@override
String myDateTime(DateTime timestamp) {
  final intl.DateFormat timestampDateFormat = intl.DateFormat('MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss', localeName);
  final String timestampString = timestampDateFormat.format(timestamp);

  return '$timestampString';
}
```

Create or migrate an existing package, as explained in official materials: https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors

Set `Platforms` in your `Package.swift` to desired version, e.g:

```swift
    platforms: [
        .iOS(.v13),
    ],
```

Reference this package in your example application, as explained in: https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers

Set your `Minimum Deployment` to any number higher than package, e.g. `16.0`

The result is, project doesn't build. And while I can control my own packages's versions, I can't change versions of referenced packages, which lowers overall version in `FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage` and makes build failing.

### Expected results

Project builds, as it was with pods

### Actual results

Project fails to build

The Android Studio bundled Java 21, Flutter just didn't support it (maybe gradle, however already used latest one)

How to resolve it?

I also converted the `.sh` and `.bat` files (largely) to Dart, mostly because I don't know enough Windows XP command prompt in order to make the change safely. They should still run the same from the CI bootstrapping, but most of the logic is now Dart code.

1. Use any kind of Isolates in Flutter web project
2. Run on Chrome browser
3. Watch it burn giving following errors when doing `flutter run`:

Another exception was thrown: Instance of 'minified:iT<erased>'
Uncaught Error: Instance of 'minified:wg'
Uncaught Error: Unsupported operation: ReceivePort.sendPort


### Expected results

Isolates if not supported (seen https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/145132) should at least execute on the main thread to allow easy cross platform deployment.

### Actual results

Isolates crash on Web but run flawlessly on iOS.

### Code sample

Please create simple Flutter web app and try to create, spawn and compute in Isolate (not compute() function since https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/33577).

Hi there,

I use ColorFilter.matirx for transform images. After updating to flutter 3.27.3 i trying use WASM mode, but get a problem with ColorFilter.matrix.
Look's like a bag...

Translation column in filter matrix must be in range from 0 to 255. But when i run release WASM  build  in chrome, ColorFilter.matrix isn't  wotk.
After few expirements i found that wasm build in chrome works as expected if translation column is in range 0-1, but not 0-255 ((
Android and iOS build works properly.
And WASM build in Safari browser also work correct  with range 0-225.  


### Expected results

ColorFilter.matirx tranlation column in range 0-255

### Actual results

WASM build in Chrome,  tranlation column for ColorFilter.matirx  work only in range 0-1

The callback of `PopupMenuButton` don't work if there is an `Unique Key`.
It was working perfectly on the last version of `Flutter 3.24.5`.

Clone or run the following **example code** issue bug: https://github.com/marcellocamara/issues/tree/master/Flutter3PopupMenuButton

Removing this line `key: UniqueKey()`, the bug is fixed, allowing the `Second Page` be called normally from user click interaction event callback: 
https://github.com/marcellocamara/issues/blob/master/Flutter3PopupMenuButton/lib/main.dart#L37

This bug is only on `Flutter 3.27`. It works normally, with the `Unique Key`, at `Flutter 3.25`. I'm using a list on the real scenario. I added this unique key at Center widget just to exemplify.

### Expected results

Callback works normally, opening the `Second Page` present on **example code**.

### Actual results

Callback don't work, making it impossible to go to the `Second Page` present on **example code**.

133,"2810698691","Request to Support Overriding `libapp.so` on Android | To Enable Custom Code Push Feature","Hi Flutter Team,

We are considering implementing a code-push-like feature for our Flutter Android app, similar to how react-native-code-push operates. After reviewing the Flutter Engine codebase, specifically this file: [FlutterLoader.java](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/engine/src/flutter/shell/platform/android/io/flutter/embedding/engine/loader/FlutterLoader.java), we believe that supporting the ability to override `FlutterApplicationInfo.aotSharedLibraryName` at runtime would make it possible for us, or the community, to build a similar feature.

## How will we implement code push?

In a standard Flutter release APK, the app loads `libapp.so` by default. When a new patch is available, our custom implementation would download a new shared library (e.g., `libapp-arm64-v1.0.1.so`) specific to the device. The next time the app opens, we would use the downloaded `libapp-*.so` file, applying the patch. We could manage the correct library version to use by storing it in SharedPreferences or a similar local storage solution.



## Why not use existing solutions?

1. Shorebird.dev: It's not fully open source,
2. Flutter RFW: Implementing code push like solution using RFW adds High maintenance, complexity.


Although we could maintain a fork of Flutter internally with these changes, it seems to be a small modification within a few files under the path `engine/src/flutter/shell/platform/android/io/flutter/embedding/engine/loader/*`

## Security considerations

1. **No Impact for Apps Without Overrides:** Apps that don't implement this override will not be affected; only those with the code-push implementation will see changes.
2. **Compatibility Check:** If the newly downloaded libapp-*.so is incompatible with the app’s native build, it won’t load. so a `libapp.so` patch intended for a 3rd person shooter game is not going to work in basic calculator app.
3. **Similar to React-Native Code Push**: This approach mirrors how react-native handles code updates by delivering new `index.android.bundle` files. In this case, we'd be delivering `libapp-*.so` files, a technique that’s been widely used in production apps.



## Questions:

1. What are your thoughts on this approach?
2. Is there an existing way to achieve this that we may have missed?


Thanks for the amazing framework! We look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Fixes https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/161262

Sometimes we end up with clip replay entities that have clip depth values substantially below the current depth. I suspect this is due to either mismatched save/restore or a bug in our code. Update: this isn't a bug/bug but its definitely a bug. We can have multiple clips per save, but the restore will remove at most one from the record/replay.


If a clip has a depth value that is less than the current clip depth, it cannot by definition impact anything that draws after it.

Rather than this approach, we can allocate a new offscreen that is full sized and then blit a smaller region. To reduce the allocation costs, we can also set up a transients cache which will reuse this texture. In total, this should be more performant than the existing partial repaint (due to lack of continual re-allocation) at the cost of higher peak memory usage.

163,"2809508204","Request to Release Updated Flutter 1.22.6 Compatible with Current Xcode (ENABLE_BITCODE=NO)","Dear Flutter Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

We are working on a project that is dependent on Flutter 1.22.6 (released on January 25, 2021). Due to the project's complexity and the extensive use of dependencies that do not support null safety, updating to a more recent version of Flutter is currently unfeasible.

However, with the latest Xcode updates and evolving iOS requirements, maintaining compatibility with older Flutter versions has become challenging. Specifically, having Flutter 1.22.6 configured to work with the latest Xcode (with ENABLE_BITCODE=NO) would be immensely helpful for projects like ours that are bound to older versions.

Would it be possible for the Flutter team to release an updated version of Flutter 1.22.6 (or another stable 1.x version) that ensures compatibility with current iOS requirements? This update would greatly assist teams facing similar constraints in maintaining their projects.

While issues with Pods that use ENABLE_BITCODE can be resolved using workarounds like the one detailed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79019897/flutterxcode-16-cardinalmobile-framework-ppriskmagnes-contains-bitcode), these fixes do not address the compatibility issues with Flutter 1.22.6 itself. This makes it very difficult to get older projects running on current iOS environments.

Thank you for your continued support and understanding. I appreciate your consideration of this request.

1. Open a Flutter app targeted towards macOS (darwin).
2. Start screen recording with the built in ""screenshot"" tool in macOS.
3. Observe how Flutter no longer displays click cursors over button hovers, or resize handles at the edge of the macOS window.

### Expected results

Cursors should display appropriately while screen recording.

### Actual results

Cursors no longer displays click cursors over button hovers, or resize handles at the edge of the macOS window.

170,"2808801766","Flutter 3.27.x | Android 10, 11 | Crash: ""drawRenderNode called on a context with no surface!""","### Steps to reproduce

**Issue Summary:**

Our app uses multiple screens with WebView (flutter_inappwebview). After upgrading Flutter from version 3.24.4 to 3.27.1 to address [this issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/158961) on iOS 18.2, we started receiving a large number of crash reports on Android.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open and close multiple WebView screens (approximately 5–10 screens).
2. Open another WebView screen. While it attempts to render, press the Home button to minimize the app.
3. Reopen the app from the background right after that.
4. Observed Behavior: The app shows a black screen, ANR logs, and then crashes.

**Additional Notes:**

**1. Impeller Disabled:**
Due to [this issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/160442), Impeller is disabled on Android:
```xml
<meta-data
    android:name=""io.flutter.embedding.android.EnableImpeller""
    android:value=""false"" />
```
**2. Crash Details:**
- Crashes occur 100% of the time on devices running Android 10 and 11.
- Tested builds:
  - **Flutter 3.24.4 & 3.24.5**: No crashes observed on a Nokia 8.1 (Android 11).
  - **Flutter 3.27.1 & 3.27.3**: Crashes consistently occur on the same device (Nokia 8.1, Android 11).

1.When I enter the Flutter application from the background on my Samsung phone, it will have a semi black mask flashing
2.But when I click on the icon on the homepage of my phone to enter the app, it won't flash

### Expected results

On Samsung phones, it is necessary to enter the front desk normally without blinking.

### Actual results

I'm sorry for mentioning the same issue before, but I couldn't find a solution at the time. However, today I found a solution and added some methods to MainActivity to solve the flickering problem. Can we fix this type of problem in future versions

### Code sample

import androidx.activity.enableEdgeToEdge
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivityLaunchConfigs.BackgroundMode
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine

1. Use Flutter 3.27 (tested on 3.27.2 and 3.27.3) or master
2. Run the code sample on a **physical** iOS device (tested on iOS 18.2.1). I can **not** reproduce this on an iOS simulator running iOS 18.2.
3. Observe the black box artefacts around the image widgets.
5. Commenting out `spreadRadius` removes black box artefacts.
6. Running the same code on Android produces no such artefacts.
7. Running the same code on iOS (physical device and simulator) using `--no-enable-impeller` produces no such artefacts.
8. Running the same code sample on Flutter 3.24.5 produces no such artefacts on iOS (physical device and simulator)### Expected results

No black box artefacts around images.

### Actual results

Black box artefacts around images.

- Adds logic to emit newly compiled sources to a file that can be read by the bootstrapper.
- Adds bootstrapping logic to reload scripts as needed. This involves implementing the necessary hot restart callback, fetching and processing the emitted file of newly compiled sources, cache busting, and loading the scripts onto the page. A lot of this logic is similar or identical to what we have for internal hot restart support.
- Runs existing hot restart tests with the new bundle format.
- Adds meta tag to run with utf-8 like in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/161493.
- Uses DWDS 24.3.3.

---

We occasionally break ourselves, our users, and the Dart up (or is it down? side-ways) stream repos (i.e. HHH) when we change how the undocumented [`update_engine_version.sh`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/bin/internal/update_engine_version.sh) script, and it's Windows counterpart [`update_engine_version.ps1`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/bin/internal/update_engine_version.ps1) work, but have no way of knowing until N days/weeks later when someone tells us.

For example, <https://flutter-review.googlesource.com/c/recipes/+/62400>.

This is my attempt to encode ""this is what you can guarantee by calling this script"".

It _still_ will be an internal only API that we might rev at any time, but at least we:

1. Can tell the Dart team ""this is tested and how it works""
2. If we want to change it, the tests will keep us from changing it without informing folks it changed

These tests should (in theory) cover both Linux/MacOS and Windows.

Sometimes we end up with clip replay entities that have clip depth values substantially below the current depth. I suspect this is due to either mismatched save/restore or a bug in our code. Update: this isn't a bug/bug but its definitely a bug. We can have multiple clips per save, but the restore will remove at most one from the record/replay.


If a clip has a depth value that is less than the current clip depth, it cannot by definition impact anything that draws after it.

On some Oppo devices, our apps suddenly became impossible to use due to huge glitches when Flutter was upgraded to 3.27.0.

This could not be fixed by opting out of Impeller in Android builds.

By downgrading Flutter to 3.25.4, the problem is temporarily fixed.


### Expected results

With Flutter 3.25.4 we get the expected screen:

- Removed the old `flutter_driver_android_test` shards and references
- Override `AndroidManifest.xml` per backend, forcing that backend to be used (no fallbacks) or it fails
- Bumps the Android emulator to 35 due to the use of magic strings, I think

The check for the Impeller backend actually being used is the honor system right now, as a bug in `flutter drive` (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/162087) prevents me from seeing error output, meaning that it's impossible to be sure a particular Impeller backend is used (or understand why a crash happens), so I guess I'll work on that next.

I try to implement watchkit to my app with this tutorial:

https://github.com/theamorn/flutter-apple-watch/tree/main

It is working perfectly. WCSession is working and invokeMethod as well.

But since I want to have an animated LaunchScreen, I have built a SplashController according to this tutorial and then change the rootViewController within the SplashController:

`appDelegate.window?.rootViewController = flutterViewController`

### Actual results

After adding the LaunchScreen, the invokeMethod function no longer works and the sending between watch and iPhone as well. I get the following error:

```

### Description 

According to the [SafeArea.maintainBottomViewPadding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SafeArea/maintainBottomViewPadding.html) docs, it is expected that `NavigationBar` will shift when the view padding changes. This PR provides ability to override the `maintainBottomViewPadding` property in the under `SafeArea` in the `NavigationBar`.

208,"2806883149","[SwiftPM] FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage uses Flutter's minimum iOS version, instead of looking at project settings","### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new Flutter project with Flutter 3.27 or higher
2. Ensure that the project uses SwiftPM
3. Add the following dependencies to the project: (see the attached pubspec.lock for exact versions)
```
firebase_analytics: ^11.4.1
firebase_core: ^3.10.1
firebase_crashlytics: ^4.3.1
firebase_messaging: ^15.2.1
```
4. Specify a higher minimum iOS version, per the Firebase requirement
- `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 13.0;` in `ios/Runnerxcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `MinimumOSVersion` to `13.0` in `ios/Flutter/AppFrameworkInfo.plist`
- `platform :ios, '13.0'` in `ios/Podfile`
- override the minimum ios deployment target for pods using the following in the Podfile

```
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '13.0'
    end
  end
end
```
5. Try to build the iOS app in XCode
6. The build fails with an error like the following: (see the screenshot)
```
The package product 'firebase-analytics' requires minimum platform version 13.0 for the iOS platform, but this target supports 12.0
The package product 'firebase-core' requires minimum platform version 13.0 for the iOS platform, but this target supports 12.0
The package product 'firebase-crashlytics' requires minimum platform version 13.0 for the iOS platform, but this target supports 12.0
The package product 'firebase-messaging' requires minimum platform version 13.0 for the iOS platform, but this target supports 12.0
```

### Expected results

The used Firebase versions require iOS 13.0 or higher. Thus the project specifies this in the project settings.
The generated `FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage/Package.swift` file should use the project level minimum supported version, as defined in the project.

Perhaps the `MinimumOSVersion` in `ios/Flutter/AppFrameworkInfo.plist` is a good candidate for this.
And MacOS probably also needs to be considered.

### Actual results

The build fails due to the minimum iOS version in the `FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage/Package.swift` being _Flutter's_ minimum iOS version.

See the attached `FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage/Package.swift` for an example.
Note: The project where I reproduced this also used other dependencies in the `FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage/Package.swift`, but those do not seem to be related to the issue.

The culprit _might_ be the hardcoded versions in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/9ded795e6396e0a38faabb7c64f846dd6e54c682/packages/flutter_tools/lib/src/macos/swift_package_manager.dart#L33-L43

When creating `Slider` widgets, the `Slider.label` information isn't passed to the semantics widget.

### Expected results

Sliders should announce their labels when tabbing through with a screen reader such as NVDA. I can't test platforms other than Windows or Chrome while at work.

### Actual results

NVDA announces ""Slider"", then the percentage.

The third slider works perfectly. Looking at the implementation of the `Slider` widget, it seems that there is no `label` property being passed to the `Semantics` widget at the end of the `_buildMaterialSlider` method.

I've tested this locally, and adding the `label` argument fixes this.
Am I OK to submit a PR with this change? I don't really know how all of this works. I'm keen to help, but - depending on how much vetting I'll need - it might be quicker for someone else to add `label: widget.label` to line 1083 of `slider.dart`. 😄

Thank you for a wonderful framework!!

Clone repository: https://github.com/rmatif/Local-Diffusion
Build and run in debug mode - works correctly
Build release APK: flutter build apk --release --target-platform android-arm64
Install and run release APK
Initialize model and generate an image
Observe crash after image generation completes

Already attempted fixes:

- Added ProGuard rules to preserve FFI classes

<details open><summary>proguard-rules.pro</summary>

```pro
-keep class * extends ffi.Struct {
    *;
}
-keep class * implements ffi.Finalizable {
    *;
}
-keep class ffi_bindings.FFIBindings { # Keep the FFIBindings class itself
    *; # Keep all members
}
-keep class sd_image.SDImage { # Keep the SDImage class
    *; # Keep all members
}
-keep class com.example.local_diffusion.** { # Keep your main app package.  Be more specific if possible.
    *;
}

# If you have specific callback functions that are only called from native code:
-keepclassmembers class ffi_bindings.FFIBindings {
    public static void _staticLogCallback(int, ffi.Pointer, ffi.Pointer); # Example, adjust names
    public static void _staticProgressCallback(int, int, double, ffi.Pointer); # Example, adjust names
}

-keepclassmembers class sd_image.SDImage { # Keep members of SDImage
    public int width; # Keep specific fields accessed from native side (if any direct access)
    public int height;
    public int channel;
    public ffi.Pointer data;
    *; # Keep all members for safety, refine if needed later
}

-keepclassmembers class com.example.local_diffusion.stable_diffusion_processor.StableDiffusionProcessor { # Keep members if needed
    *; # Keep all members for safety, refine if needed later
}

-keep,allowshrinking,allowobfuscation class com.example.local_diffusion.** { # Keep your main app package
    <methods>;
    <fields>;
    <init>(...);
}

-keepattributes Signature
-keepattributes *Annotation*

- Modified memory management approach
- The issue appears specific to release mode builds while handling FFI image data transfer







### Expected results

Image should be displayed and saved successfully after generation, same as in debug mode.

### Actual results

App crashes with SIGSEGV (signal 11) after image generation completes

`signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 2 (SEGV_ACCERR), fault addr 0x0000007600aac080

I render a lot of data in a scrolling list, The list is wrapped with RepaintBoundary, In addition to Android, other platforms are very smooth, including the Android web is also very smooth, You can visit the link below to experience, And then hit an Android bag yourself will find that the list is very slow.

example preview: [https://luoyi58624.github.io/scroll_example/](https://luoyi58624.github.io/scroll_example/)

========== update ============
After further testing, Even without the RepaintBoundary wrap, Android is much slower than web

### Expected results

Please fix the problem of stalling on Android

214,"2805861584","Unable to load libflutter.so causing crash on Samsung Android 7.1.2 (i686 architecture) with libdatastore_shared_counter.so","### Steps to reproduce

The following log is from a Firebase Crashlytics report




### Expected results

The app crashes during initialization. 

### Actual results

**Device Details:**

Device: Samsung Galaxy S10 5G
OS: Android 7.1.2
CPU Architecture: i686

**Description:**
When running the Flutter application on a Samsung device with Android 7.1.2, the app crashes during initialization. The issue is related to the inability to load libflutter.so, which seems to be caused by the device's architecture (i686) being unsupported by Flutter Android. Additionally, the native libraries directory contains libdatastore_shared_counter.so, which may contribute to the issue.

This increases the RMSE value in the test in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/161445 by a slight amount.  I do believe this reduces the time where we get non uniform scalars and protects the integrity of relative spacing, thus being more what we expect.  There is still a bug that has to do with pixel alignment that does give the illusion of stretching and shrinking though because of hard/soft lines.

I also converted the `.sh` and `.bat` files (largely) to Dart, mostly because I don't know enough Windows XP command prompt in order to make the change safely. They should still run the same from the CI bootstrapping, but most of the logic is now Dart code.

Previously `CachedLocalEngineArtifacts` was returning `flutter_tester` from the local target build directory. `flutter_tester` is a host build artifact and thus should be returned from the local host engine directory, not the local target build directory.

Some history: A long time ago, desktop artifacts were produced as part of the host builds; and in fact, they still are, but ideally shouldn't be. At some point we added target builds for macOS, Windows, and Linux embedders, but failed to clean the target artifacts out of the host builds.

This causes Flutter CI tree redness due to out-of-band updates to the flutter/tests repo.

We can solve the out-of-band breakage by pinning flutter/tests in flutter/flutter.

We could do that by adding a file to flutter/flutter (next to that `ci.sh` script) that contains the flutter/tests commit hash to pull. Then in `ci.sh`, we'd pull that commit hash instead of computing the commit hash (which is usually tip-of-tree flutter/tests) with the current script.

How to avoid flutter/tests hash becoming stale? We can add text to the flutter/tests PR template loudly asking committers there to activate their flutter/tests change by updating the hash checked into the file in flutter/flutter.

228,"2805503011","[Proposal]: CupertinoNavigationBarBackButton long-press gesture","### Use case

Native apps that use default iOS navigation allow a long-press gesture on the back button to show a list of views in the history stack. The user can drag their finger to a specific view to pop to it with haptic feedback between items.

Examples found in most built-in apps such as Notes, Calendar and Mail but can also be seen in third-party apps that use the normal navigation push/pop structure and app bar. Screen recording of Example in the calendar app recorded on an iPhone 15 Pro Max on iOS 18.2:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a10c7e28-cf26-41c3-b49c-5ff3b85e2887

### Proposal

This should probably work out-of-the-box when using a basic `Cupertino` style app such as the following:

```
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoApp(
      home: CupPage(),
    );
  }
}

class CupPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const CupPage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoPageScaffold(
      navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(),
      child: Builder(builder: (context) {
        return Center(
          child: TextButton(
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.of(context).push(CupertinoPageRoute(
                    title: 'Next Page', builder: (context) => CupPage()));
              },
              child: Text('Push')),
        );
      }),
    );
  }
}
```

Hello! Thank you for reading and considering my feature request.

I started developing Flutter apps 4 months ago and it has been an awesome experience so far! :)

The problem I ran into that led me to request this feature is:

I wanted to implement a feature where I can drag items (say cards) into different buckets. I was amazed at how easy this was to achieve with DragTarget and Draggable. However, the next feature we wanted was to be able to scale and rotate the card before dropping it in.

I tried a combination of Draggable and GestureDetector and the onScaleStart and onScaleUpdate doesn't get called. I also found a few old posts about this:

https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/28202
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/64428

Thanks again for the time! I would also appreciate any pointers on how to do this with the existing framework capabilities.

### Proposal

I would like to be able to scale and rotate a Draggable widget. 

I am proposing exposing callbacks for onScaleStart/Update/End or supporting another way to access these callbacks.","closed","2025-01-22 18:23:03","2025-01-24 14:50:55","1",NULL,NULL,"kirstenkoa",NULL,"2025-01-25 00:06:01","Padrões de Projeto","44.464444444444446"

* Pub workspaces are now supported, this requires a refactoring to how the `NativeAssetsBuildRunner` is used. Most notably it requires being explicit about the `runPackageName`. Flutter does not seem to have that value, but it does have the `projectUri` which can be used to find the package name via the package config.
* The API for build hooks has been redesigned. This PR updates the project template, test project files, and test project strings.

I am using macOS to authenticate the user and display some basic information.

Everything works great in debug mode and I am able to authenticate users properly without a single problem. The complete code even works great on windows.

But when I create a .dmg file of my product, I am again and again getting this error in the console provided by Mac:
11.4.2 - [FirebaseCore][I-COR000005] No app has been configured yet

The app opens, loads like it should and then closes as soon as it needs to sign in.

All the solutions are for iOS where they ask to change ios/AppDelegate.swift but I am building for macOS and that file is completely different.

I am new to the MacOS ecosystem and it is very difficult for me to understand what the error may be.

In my real use case, I am trying to access a C file that contains an array of globals, but whenever I access a member of that array, Flutter unexpectedly quits on me. I recreated a smaller example to share using the below steps (my apologies for how long this example is, this is the most I could cut the example down while maintaining the structure my code has):

1. Create new flutter project.1. In the root directory of the project, run `flutter create --platforms=android,ios,macos,windows,linux --template=plugin_ffi pointer_plugin`

1. Add the new plugin to the `pubspec.yaml` with 

    ```
    dependencies:
        pointer_plugin:
            path: pointer_plugin
    ```

1. In `/pointer_plugin/src/pointer_plugin.h`, add the following lines:

    ```
    FFI_PLUGIN_EXPORT extern int globalFoo;
    FFI_PLUGIN_EXPORT extern int globals[];
    ```

1. Create new file globals.c  in `/pointer_plugin/src` and add the following lines:

    ```
    #include ""pointer_plugin.h""
    FFI_PLUGIN_EXPORT int globalFoo = 42;
    FFI_PLUGIN_EXPORT int globals[] = {3, 2, 1};
    ```

1. Add `src/globals.c` to `/pointer_plugin/ffigen.yaml` under headers.entry-points:

    ```
    headers:
      entry-points:
        - 'src/pointer_plugin.h'
        - 'src/globals.c'
    ````

1. Add `src/globals.c` to `/pointer_plugin/src/CMakeLists.txt` in add_library:

    ```
    add_library(pointer_plugin SHARED
      ""pointer_plugin.c""
      ""globals.c""
    )
    ```

1. Run ffigen in /pointer_plugin using `dart run ffigen --config ffigen.yaml`. This creates `/pointer_plugin/lib/pointer_plugin_bindings_generated.dart`

1. In `/pointer_plugin/lib/pointer_plugin.dart`, create functions that access the globals declared above:

    ```
    int getGlobal() => _bindings.globalFoo;
    Pointer<Int> getGlobals() => _bindings.globals;
    ```

1.  In `/lib/main.dart`, import pointer_plugin and dart:ffi with:

    ```
    import 'dart:ffi';
    import 'package:pointer_plugin/pointer_plugin.dart' as pointer_plugin;
    ````


1. In `/lib/main.dart`, replace the contents of `main()` with the following:

    ```
    print('Got global: ${pointer_plugin.getGlobal()}');
    final Pointer<Int> globals = pointer_plugin.getGlobals();
    print('Globals: ${globals[0]}');
    print('Globals: ${globals[1]}');
    print('Globals: ${globals[2]}');
   ```

1. Run main with breakpoints. It accesses globalFoo correctly, but once main gets to the line trying to access globals[0], execution will halt before even running the line. On VSCode, a warning pops up with `resume: (-32000) Bad state: The client closed with pending request ""resume"".`

### Expected results

main.dart should be able to access `globals` from C without crashing

### Actual results

main.dart crashes when accessing the data pointed to by `globals`

### Code sample

<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>

Since this example includes a lot of code, I omitted comments and functions created by the ffigen template (namely `sum` and `sum_long_running`)

/pointer_plugin/pubspec.yaml and /pointer_plugin/src/pointer_plugin.c are unmodified from ffigen template

/lib/main.dart
```dart
import 'dart:ffi';
import 'package:pointer_plugin/pointer_plugin.dart' as pointer_plugin;

void main() {
  print('Got global: ${pointer_plugin.getGlobal()}');
  final Pointer<Int> globals = pointer_plugin.getGlobals();
  print('Globals: ${globals[0]}');
  print('Globals: ${globals[1]}');
  print('Globals: ${globals[2]}');
}

Not sure how to reproduce this was not an issue for months of development. 

### Actual results

I am trying to build and debug a desktop application on Windows 
```
Major  Minor  Build  Revision

```

I can build and run the application.
flutter run:

  Edge (web)        • edge    • web-javascript • Microsoft Edge 132.0.2957.115

Run ""flutter emulators"" to list and start any available device emulators.

If you expected another device to be detected, please run ""flutter doctor"" to diagnose potential issues. You may also try increasing the time to wait for connected devices with the    
""--device-timeout"" flag. Visit https://flutter.dev/setup/ for troubleshooting tips.
```

However **I cannot debug using VSCODE**. 
When I try to debug
```
Select a device to use
```
pops up but there are no options. 

Bottom right corner of VSCODE I see 
```
Plain Text | Cursor Tab | No Device 
```

It seems tha VSCode does not understand that windows device is working. 

I tried a full re-install of VSCode including removing all %appdata% and %userdata% folders 
as well as a full re-install of flutter SDK. 

Any suggestions are welcome.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Run the attached code sample on iOS

### Expected results

The polyline uses rounded caps and joints as specified in the code.

Here's how it looks like on Android:

Here's the same thing on the Web:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c24f7ca4-76f5-4d1b-8596-9d92488d8249)

### Actual results

The polyline ignores the startCap, endCap and joint settings:

### Steps to reproduce

1. Run the attached code sample in Chrome

### Expected results

Icon is yellow because of `BitmapDescriptor.defaultMarkerWithHue(BitmapDescriptor.hueYellow)`.

This is how it looks like on Android:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b289db4b-826f-4e85-97dc-840bfa451727)

### Actual results

Icon is red.

At this time, google.maps.Marker is not scheduled to be discontinued, but google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement is recommended over google.maps.Marker. While google.maps.Marker will continue to receive bug fixes for any major regressions, existing bugs in google.maps.Marker will not be addressed. At least 12 months notice will be given before support is discontinued.

291,"2801930362","Swift ""Executing channel handlers on background threads"" example doesn't work","### Steps to reproduce

1. create plugin with command: `flutter create --org com.example_test_background_thread --template=plugin --platforms=ios -i swift background_plugin`
2. Add to `ios/Classes/BackgroundPlugin.swift` within `register` method `let taskQueue = registrar.messenger.makeBackgroundTaskQueue()` like mentioned in [example](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels#executing-channel-handlers-on-background-threads:~:text=content_copy-,In%20Swift%3A,-info)
3. Get `Method 'messenger' was used as a property; add () to call it`.
4. Get `Function produces expected type 'FlutterStandardMethodCodec'; did you mean to call it with '()'?`
4. Change to `let taskQueue = registrar.messenger().makeBackgroundTaskQueue()` and to `FlutterStandardMethodCodec.sharedInstance()`
5. Get `Value of optional type '(() -> any FlutterTaskQueue)?' must be unwrapped to a value of type '() -> any FlutterTaskQueue'` error
6. Change to `let taskQueue = registrar.messenger().makeBackgroundTaskQueue?()`
7. Success. Which is not what example provides.

### Expected results

Code provided from [example](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels#executing-channel-handlers-on-background-threads:~:text=content_copy-,In%20Swift%3A,-info) works ""as is"" without modifying

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Error (Xcode): Framework 'Flutter' not found  
Error (Xcode): Linker command failed with exit code 1  
I've tried the following steps:

Recreated the ios/ folder and cleared derived data.
Ran flutter clean, reinstalled CocoaPods (pod deintegrate and pod install).
Verified AppDelegate and framework paths in Xcode.
Ensured the deployment target is set to 14.0 in the Podfile.
Despite these efforts, the issue persists. I'm using the latest Flutter SDK, Xcode, and macOS versions. Any guidance to resolve this would be greatly appreciated


AppDelegateSwift   
```swift
import Flutter

  ) -> Bool {

    return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }
}
```
  and my podfile 
```

  end

  File.foreach(generated_xcode_build_settings_path) do |line|
    matches = line.match(/FLUTTER_ROOT\=(.*)/)
    return matches[1].strip if matches
  end
  raise ""FLUTTER_ROOT not found in #{generated_xcode_build_settings_path}. Try deleting Generated.xcconfig, then run flutter pub get""

           <asynchronous suspension>
            I've attempted the following solutions to resolve the issue:
```
Performed flutter clean, removed and reinstalled Pods (pod deintegrate, pod install).
Deleted derived data using rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData.
Recreated the ios/ folder.
Updated CocoaPods and ensured all dependencies in pubspec.yaml are up-to-date.
Verified AppDelegate.swift and ensured Firebase setup (added FirebaseCore initialization in AppDelegate.swift).
Despite these efforts, the issue persists. Initially, I managed to resolve it by running these steps in sequence:

bash
Copy
Edit
flutter clean  
rm -rf ios/Pods  
rm -rf ios/.symlinks  
rm -rf ios/Flutter/Flutter.framework  
sudo gem install cocoapods  
pod repo update  
cd ios  
pod install  
flutter upgrade  
flutter pub get  
cd ios  
pod deintegrate  
pod install  
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData  
flutter clean  
flutter pub get  
cd ios  
pod install  
cd ..  
flutter run
This fixed the issue temporarily. However, after two days, I faced errors in Firebase phone authentication. I added FirebaseCore initialization in AppDelegate.swift, which resolved the Firebase error but reintroduced the ""Framework 'Flutter' not found"" error.

I’m seeking guidance to resolve this persistent issue once and for all. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

I want to explore. application can be split into multiple independent modules (microservices), where each module is a separate `MaterialApp`, and they do not interfere with each other. This can be achieved through the following approach. This design is suitable for scenarios requiring high modularity, independent development, and deployment.

Validating form data input across multiple form fields is not supported.  For example, comparing 'start' and 'finish' data form fields to ensure that start is before or equal to finish. 

A work around is possible by using global keys at a field level, but this becomes increasingly complex to manage over multiple fields. 


### Proposal

Add an 'onValidate' function attribute at the form widget level that would be called after all field level validations have passed.
